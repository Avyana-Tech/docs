**Self Driving Car**

AVYANA is an open-source project for autonomous self-driving cars. It is based off on ROS2 and is aimed for both dev and production environments on a variety of ground based vehicles.

Start by installing [Core](https://github.com/Avyana-Tech/core).

![Architecture](https://github.com/Avyana-Tech/docs/blob/main/static/img/architecture.png)
The **CORE** repository is a meta repository, that interfaces all other required repositories. It is built in this manner, as it is expected that everyone would be cloning the **CORE REPOSITORY**.
