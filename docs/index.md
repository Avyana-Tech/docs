**Self Driving Car**

AVYANA is an open-source project for autonomous self-driving cars. It is based off on ROS2 and is aimed for both dev and production environments on a variety of ground based vehicles.

Start by installing [AVYANA](https://github.com/Avyana-Tech/Avyana.git).

![Architecture](./assets/architecture.png)

The **Avyana** repository is a meta repository, that interfaces all other required repositories. It is built in this manner, so that it becomes easy for us to build individual sub-systems, and it becomes easier for the end-user to debug.
