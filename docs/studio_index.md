The **AVYANA STUDIO** is an open-source ROS Visualisation platform, that can be customized as you want it. It is available in a variety of ways to make development as convenient as possible â€“ it can be run as a standalone Desktop App on **[MAC](#)**, **[WINDOWS](#)** & **[LINUX](#)**, as a **[Web-App](https://studio.avyana.tech/)** or even as a Self-hosted app using Docker.

It is cross-platform and can connect to your **ROBOT** over wifi. Even if your ROS Stack, is running on a different Operating System, you can visualize, command and even change parameters from **Avyana Studio**, without having to do any extra-setup.
